**Features:**
- Qualitative and quantitative analysis
- Highly experienced scientific team
- Consistent reproducible results

TEM is the best method to cross-validate particle size and size distribution data acquired from other methods, such as Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), or tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS).

Immunogold TEM is a direct and powerful tool for the phenotypic characterization of EVs in addition to traditional TEM and protein analysis.

Our SEM technique allows for high-resolution imaging of particles in the sub-micron range. This means that we can study the fine details of your nanoparticles and exosomes down to their morphology and surface characteristics.",n/a,"Fill out their contact form, call, or email"
