Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is a core competency at the Center for Nanoscale Systems (CNS). CNS boasts a state-of-the-art collection of high-resolution, aberration-corrected, and cryogenic TEMs. These tools, coupled with training and guidance from knowledgeable staff members, empower the CNS community to visualize and analyze specimens at ultra-high spatial resolution.

**High Resolution TEM:**

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) at CNS is a powerful tool for materials analysis, providing visualization of the atomic lattice. This technique offers crucial insights into a material's structure, defects, homogeneity, and composition.

- Four HRTEMs are available at CNS for materials analysis.
- Each HRTEM is capable of high-resolution imaging and diffraction analysis.
- Dedicated diffraction cameras, EDS, and/or EELS detectors are available on some instruments.
- Specialized specimen holders for advanced TEM imaging and analysis are accessible.

In-situ electron microscopy at CNS allows for real-time visualization and analysis of chemical reactions and other dynamic processes. Various customized holders are available for in-situ TEM/STEM experiments.

**Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM):**

Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) is a complimentary technique to TEM imaging. In STEM, a focused electron beam is rastered across the specimen, and the transmitted beam is analyzed. Typical STEM analyses include dark field imaging, bright field imaging, and spatially resolved analytical signals such as energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) or electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).

- CNS has two STEM instruments for high-resolution imaging combined with analytical analysis.
- One instrument is a probe-corrected cold FEG system, offering very high spatial and spectral resolution.
- The system is equipped with multiple imaging and analytical detectors.","To proceed, enroll as a Remote CNS User by following these steps:
